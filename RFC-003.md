# Hide and seek


Hider: A hider first chooses a city name and keeps it secret. The hider peer then listens on a specific TCP port using a ZeroMQ ROUTER socket and waits incoming "guess" requests.

Seeker: A seeker peer connects to a known hider peer using a ZeroMQ DEALER socket. A hider peer can be found using the protocol defined in RFC-002.

NOTE: When using RFC-002, the hider peer should register his TCP port number with the broker.

When the seeker peer connects to a hider peer it sends a single string message representing the guessed city name.

The hider peer in turn answers with `CORRECT` if string recieved from the seeker matches case insensitively with the hider secret city. For any other siutation the hider will respond with `INCORRECT`.

Note: The string formats will be in UTF-8

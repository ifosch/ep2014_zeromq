# Hide and seek

The broker binds a ROUTER socket to `tcp://0.0.0.0:5555`. The clients
connects using a DEALER socket to `tcp://172.16.16.228:5555`.

Client connects to the server over a socket and sends a command:

```
REGISTER <my ip address>:<port number>
```

The broker responds with a list of peers in the following whitespace separated formatted
response:

```
<ip address>:<port> <ip2>:<port2> ...
```

The broker also provides a list of registered clients without the client
having to register itself, like this:

```
LIST
```

to which the broker responds with the same list of clients detailed above.
